# This code solves a basic inverse kinematics.

# This code may still contain some bugs so please be be careful as I can not take any responsibility. So please test this code
# thoroughly beforehand by giving a variety of inputs, and confirm that it gives the required output. 
# Also, the input - the coordinates - must be within the reach of the leg, otherwise it will cause math error
